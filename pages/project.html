                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>The SunMade Cheese project is more about enjoying solar power and promoting education for solar technology, but the Solar Cow is really a lifeline for people. They are two projects for two different perspectives, but combined in one initiative.</p>
                <p>The milk produced by cows sustains life, and our solar cow sustains education. We loved the idea of using the cow as a symbol to show our commitment to sustainability and philosophy of ‘Solar for all’.     </p>
