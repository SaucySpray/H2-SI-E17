                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>The SunMade Cheese project is more about enjoying solar power and promoting education for solar technology, but the Solar Cow is really a lifeline for people. They are two projects for two different perspectives, but combined in one initiative.</p>
                <p>The milk produced by cows sustains life, and our solar cow sustains education. We loved the idea of using the cow as a symbol to show our commitment to sustainability and philosophy of ‘Solar for all’.     </p>

            <h1>"Solar Cow Project in Africa, solar for everyone"</h1>
            <p>One of YOLK’s core values is “Solar for Everyone”. In line with that philosophy, the team prepared for this project by delivering and installing a Solar Cow at a primary school in Pokot, Kenya and gave power banks that can be charged from the Solar cow to the students. </p>

            <p>Meet SunMade Cheese! This tasty cheese plate is really a solar panel plus an array of solar powered accessories. There’s a brie cheese USB port and connector for the milk bottle power bank, a swiss cheese speaker.</p>
            <p>The cheese plate collects energy from the sun and stores it in the milk bottle power bank. Embedded magnets and special connectors attach the milk bottle to each of the cheeses and bring them to life. </p>
